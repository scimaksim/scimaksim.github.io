I was raised in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, two former Republics of the Soviet Union. As a consequence of job scarcity and rampant inflation, which peaked shortly after my birth, my parents sought a better life in America. We immigrated to the United States in 2002.

After completing my undergraduate studies at UCLA (where I had the privilege of taking Astronomy 81 with Andrea Ghez, [winner of the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2020/ghez/facts/)), I coded human-machine interfaces and telemetry hardware for a local ready-mix concrete company. In 2015, I visited Research Triangle Park for a four-month-long job training program at Cisco Systems. In 2017, I became a North Carolina resident. Today, I work as a systems engineer for Red Hat.
