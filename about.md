I was raised in two former Soviet republics, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. When the Soviet Union collapsed and inflation rates skyrocketed (as shown in the World Bank chart below), my parents sought a better life in America. We immigrated to the United States in 2002.

I had planned to pursue a career in science but, alas, my talents in mathematics never transpired. After completing my undergraduate studies at UCLA (where I had the privilege of taking _Astrophysics I: Stars and Nebulae_ with Andrea Ghez, [winner of the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2020/ghez/facts/)), I coded human-machine interfaces and telemetry hardware for a local ready-mix concrete company. I loved watching my work manifest itself across hundreds of trucks and dozens of concrete batch plants in Southern California, but I soon grew restless and accepted an opportunity to work as a network solutions engineer. After spending five months at Cisco's Morrisville offices, I decided to re-locate to the Triangle permanently. Today, I work as a solutions engineer for Raleigh-based [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en).
