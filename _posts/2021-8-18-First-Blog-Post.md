title: Data science? An introspection
---

This post is a response to the following prompt:

_What do you think being a data scientist is about? What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas? What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians? How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?_

In his best seller _The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail-but Some Don't_, author and statistician Nate Silver cites estimates of the enormous quantities of data that have been generated in recent years (Silver, 2015). While some have argued that "the sheer amount of data would obviate the need for theory" (Silver, 2015, p. 9), Silver asserts that 
> "The numbers have no way of speaking for themselves. We speak for them. We imbue them with meaning. Like Caesar, we may construe them in self-serving ways that are detached from their objective reality (Silver, 2015, p. 9)."

Being a data scientist is chiefly about ascertaining meaning from data. Doing so in close alignment with "objective reality" is the data scientist's duty. 

Statisticians have spent decades creating the theoretical foundation for interpreting data. As computers and digitial media matured, data scientists began to cleanse data in software, apply domain knowledge and process the data mathematically, draw conclusions, and communicate these conclusions to colleagues and stakeholders. Some have chosen to summarize information from the past, whereas others have strived to develop models that predict future behavior. When ostensibly effective models emerge, machine learning engineers may be tasked with implementing them, often at large scale.   

Personally, I possess stronger intuition for software than I do for statistics. I am comfortable with aggregating data from a variety of sources, procesing it, and communicating my findings. However, my inferential abilities are certainly no match for someone who is mathematically inclined.
