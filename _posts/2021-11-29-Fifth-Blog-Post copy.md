title: Final reflection
---

This post is a response to the following prompt:

_Go back and read your initial blog post where we discussed data science as well as your blog post about your thoughts on R.  Write a reflection post about:_

_-what (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do_
_- what your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?_
_- what things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?_

In my first blog post, I summarised my notion of what data science is as follows: 

> Statisticians have spent decades creating the theoretical foundation for 
> interpreting data. As computers and digitial media matured, data scientists 
> began to cleanse data in software, apply domain knowledge and process the data 
> mathematically, draw conclusions, and communicate these conclusions to 
> colleagues and stakeholders. Some have chosen to summarize information from 
> the past, whereas others have strived to develop models that predict future 
> behavior. When ostensibly effective models emerge, machine learning engineers 
> may be tasked with implementing them, often at large scale.   

After completing ST 558, I think my presumptions were relatively accurate. While working on projects, particularly projects 1 and 3, I spent a substantial amount of time applying domain knowledge while interpreting data and ensuring that missing values would not affect models or the performance of R packages. We also had multiple modules dedicated to supervised and unsupervised learning, ways to assess the performance of our models, and ways to present our models (e.g. via GitHub Pages and Shiny). 

Most of my encounters with R focus on the system administration side, such as ways to install R in containerized environments and manage it with Kubernetes. However, I had a lot of fun learning the language and would love to continue working with it. I plan to continue exploring the capabilities of Shiny dashboards and incorporate them into job-related data science demonstrations. 

Thank you, Dr. Post, for a fantastic course!
